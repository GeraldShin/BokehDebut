# BokehDebut
This is the first couple of times I coded Bokeh graphics from scratch.
This was more of an introductory exercise to apply what I had learned from my Bootcamp and bring in real business value. 
Both of these visualizations are made from scratch with no imported code snippets.


# Debut 1 - RelationshipGrowth.py
This was the very first time I had done my own Bokeh visualization. The purpose was to practice using the hover features and create two
side by side plots. I created a .csv file that had month over month values for the last 5 years for each the total loan volume and the 
total deposit volume. I also locked the axes so that whenever you scroll/zoom/pan in one graph, it would mirror that in the other graph. 

# Debut 2 - CheckingGrowth.py
This was the second time I created a Bokeh visualization. The purpose this time around was to add a few features to the graph and play 
around with more of the functionalities in the Bokeh package. I added a 3rd line in a separate graph to increase the complexity and info
provided by the visualization. To further practice my skills, I added in a legend for each subplot, the coding was a simple addition to 
what I had in the first visualization. 

I added a simple Y=0 to show the positive gains line, I felt like this gave the viewer a quick and 
immediate understanding of when membership grew or contracted. I also excluded a significant variance in values caused by a business 
merger with another financial institution. 

# What I would change about these:
I would like to play around more with the drop-down menu functionality. 
I also feel like there would be some QoL changes like formatting the tooltips/axes better that would help the enduser (me).

Overall, I think I could do this easier inside Tableau but I understand that not every company will necessarily have a Tableau
deployment and/or that Bokeh code is customizable down to the tiniest detail. It is a fun & useful package to learn, I just need to get
faster at it.
